    "For the analysis in this notebook we consider all data $\\mathcal{D}$ to be drawn from a joint sampling distribution whose dependency on *slow* model source parameters is expressed in terms of a *single* pulse. The justification for such an assumption is that we are performing parameter estimation given a synthetic data set for a model *pulsar* with a stable (effectively non-evolving) surface radiation field, with any quasi-periodicity arising solely from relative orbital motion of source and telescope. The synthetic data is intended to emulate detection of photons over a long observing run, after which the photon incidence events are phase-folded during a pre-processing phase.\n",

In other words, in X-PSI, **we do not use Python callback functions for evaluation of specific intensities, but C functions which are compiled when the** X-PSI **package is built**. Unfortunately this means that to change the parametrised surface radiation field you need to get your hands a little dirty; on the bright side, the body of these functions can be implemented almost completely in the Cython language, so syntactically there is some similarity to Python because the language syntax is somewhat of a hybrid/superset. Beware, however, that the body of these functions must not contain calls to the Python API, and only to external C libraries if required: the code must evaluate to pure C, and not require the Python/C API. Note that the Python global interpreter lock is deactivated during integration to enable OpenMP multi-threading in some applications of the integrator; thus the code needs to be thread safe and ``nogil`` (not require the global interpreter lock, although a context manager could *in principle* be used to reacquire the lock within the integrator). Also note that if external C libraries are required, that you include a Cython .pxd (header) file in the package which ``extern``s the required library components; the library also needs to be included and linked in ``setup.py`` at package build-time.\n",

    "The description *derived from ulterior variables* means that when we lookup the value, it is calculated dynamically from the values of other (ulterior) model parameters. We clearly expect the temperature of the secondary hot region to behave in this way. A few other varibles do to because of keyword arguments passed upon instantiation of the hot regions. For example, the colatitude of the *zero-radii* omission and ceding regions (``omit=False`` and ``cede=False``) are equivalent to the colatitude of the centre of the superseding region. The azimuths are *relative* to the superseding region, and are thus listed as being *fixed* at zero azimuthal separation. If one of ``omit`` or ``cede`` was ``True``, and ``concentric=True``, a similar setup is performed, but with the radius of ``omit`` or ``cede`` being free, fixed (at finite value, but zero achieves the same as ``False`` for both ``omit`` and ``cede`` keyword arguments), or derived."

Because we implemented a transformation in our ``CustomPrior`` subclass, we can actually draw the samples and transform them, which is useful in post-processing contexts. We defined the intervals ``[-0.25, 0.75]`` for the inverse sampling so that the posterior mode(s) will not be near a boundary.  The nested sampling algorithm can handle periodic boundaries by defining ``wrapped`` parameters; however, this can be trivially avoided altogether by rough inspection of the phases of the subpulses in the data, which we can see above are at around $-0.1$ and $0.4$ given the respective ground truth (injected) phases of $\\phi_{p}=0.0$ and $\\phi_{s}=0.025$."
